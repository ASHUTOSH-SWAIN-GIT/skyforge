Create a professional Database Schema Design Canvas using React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons. The aesthetic should be "Linear-style" dark mode: technical, high-contrast, and clean.

The layout consists of a full-screen infinite grid background with interactive "Table Nodes" and a floating toolbar.

1. THE CANVAS BACKGROUND:
- Use a dark gray background (zinc-950).
- Overlay a subtle dot pattern or grid pattern (opacity 20%) to represent an infinite workspace.

2. THE CUSTOM "TABLE NODE" (The most important part):
- Create a card component representing a Database Table.
- Style: Rounded-xl, border-zinc-800, bg-zinc-900, shadow-lg.
- Header:
  - Table Name (e.g., "users", "orders") in bold, white text.
  - A small "More Options" (...) button on the right.
  - A bottom border separating header from columns.
- Body (Column List):
  - Render a list of database columns.
  - Each row should have:
    - Left and Right "Handle" dots (visual indicators for connecting lines).
    - A "Key" icon if it is a Primary Key (PK) (color gold/yellow).
    - Column Name (e.g., "id", "email") in white.
    - Data Type (e.g., "uuid", "varchar") in a muted mono-space font (text-zinc-500).
    - Constraint badges (e.g., "NN", "U") on the right side.
- Footer:
  - A full-width "Add Column" button that appears on hover, subtle and minimalist.

3. THE FLOATING TOOLBAR (Bottom Center):
- A pill-shaped floating menu with a blur effect (bg-zinc-900/80 backdrop-blur).
- Buttons for:
  - "Add Table" (Plus icon).
  - "Auto Layout" (Wand icon).
  - "Zoom In" / "Zoom Out" / "Fit View".
  - "Export SQL" (Code icon, accented color like indigo-500).

4. MOCK DATA:
- Render 2-3 tables connected by lines (visualize the edges).
- Table 1: "users" (id, email, password, created_at).
- Table 2: "posts" (id, title, content, user_id [FK]).

5. STYLE GUIDE:
- Use 'zinc' for grays.
- Use 'indigo' for primary actions and active states.
- Use a font that looks technical (Inter or a sans-serif).
