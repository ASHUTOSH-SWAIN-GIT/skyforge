Skyforge Dashboard Improvement Prompt

Improve the dashboard page by keeping the Catppuccin Mocha theme consistent and cozy while avoiding corporate SaaS design patterns. Focus on aesthetic clarity, personal feel, and soft interactions.

Increase top padding under the Workspace heading and adjust grid spacing so the project cards feel more centered and breathable. Add slightly larger vertical spacing between card rows and widen the card grid horizontally to prevent cards from looking too compressed. Add a subtle horizontal separator or a faint tinted background behind the project card section to create gentle structure without looking heavy.

Enhance the project cards by giving them a soft gradient from Surface1 to Surface0, a subtle inner border, and a smooth hover effect that adds a gentle lift or glow. Make the database type pill slightly larger, and improve the initial icon design with a better accent color and cleaner shape. Add a tiny three dot menu on the top right of each card for future actions.

Make the Create New Project card visually distinct by using a lighter Surface tint, a slightly larger plus icon, and a soft pulse or glow on hover. It should feel playful and inviting rather than looking like a normal project card.

Refine the sidebar by increasing spacing between items, adding clearer active item styling with a soft accent bar, and using slightly brighter icons while keeping text muted. Maintain a minimalist structure but improve readability and hover feedback.

Consider adding a small optional top utility strip with a transparent Mantle background and slight blur. This bar can include search, settings, or a tiny New Project button, but keep it minimal and aligned with the theme.

Tighten bottom spacing so the layout does not have unnecessary empty space. Improve typography by adjusting line height of the subtitle, slightly increasing the project title weight, and using Subtext0 for descriptions to improve hierarchy.

Add gentle micro animations: fade in cards on load, smooth transitions on hover, and subtle scaling effects that make the dashboard feel alive without being overdone. Stay consistent with Catppuccin Mocha by using Surface layers, Lavender or Mauve accents, soft shadows, and rounded corners throughout. Keep everything personal, cozy, and pleasant to use.
