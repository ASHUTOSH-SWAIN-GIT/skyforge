## **Skyforge Canvas Page Improvement Prompt**

Improve the canvas page with a focus on personal project aesthetics rather than corporate SaaS styling. Keep the Catppuccin Mocha theme consistent, soft, and cozy. Make the UI enjoyable, minimal, and visually satisfying.

Apply the following changes across the canvas:

Enhance the left sidebar by improving spacing between sections, slightly increasing padding on buttons, and making section titles clearer without heavy borders. Add subtle hover accents using Lavender or Mauve. Keep the design simple rather than enterprise. Buttons should have a soft glow or scale effect on hover.

Improve the table nodes with more visual structure. Add a soft gradient or slight blur in the background using Surface1 and Surface0. Use rounded corners, a subtle inner border, and cleaner spacing between rows. Use Catppuccin accent colors for PK, FK, NN icons. Add gentle micro animations when tables appear or when users hover.

Make relationship lines smoother by adding light curvature, more consistent dotted patterns, and a soft Lavender tinted glow on hover. When dragging a connection, animate the line slightly so it feels dynamic. Keep the lines minimal and aesthetic rather than strict.

Improve the zoom controls by making them small, rounded, and low opacity. Have them fade in on hover for a minimal interface look. Keep them simple rather than like professional PDF toolbars.

Consider adding a faint optional grid using Surface1 with very low opacity or show the grid only while dragging nodes to keep the canvas clean. Only include it if it improves comfort during placement.

Add a tiny floating utility bubble somewhere non intrusive. It can include actions like Fit View, Undo, Redo, or Toggle Grid. Keep it minimal and rounded with Catppuccin surfaces and subtle glow on hover.

Increase canvas padding so nodes do not touch edges. Ensure the canvas feels open and breathable. Adjust view fit behavior to keep spacing comfortable.

Make the bottom right logo softer by reducing brightness and increasing corner rounding. Optionally hide or fade it when dragging or zooming so it does not distract.

Keep animations gentle: slight drop when a node is created, small glow on relation endpoints on hover, soft transitions everywhere. Avoid anything too corporate or too loud.

Throughout the canvas, emphasize Catppuccin Mocha colors: Surface layers, Mauve or Lavender accents, gentle glows, and soft shadows. Maintain a consistent cozy dark look rather than a strict business application style.
